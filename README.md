# ai-product-lab-
A personal lab of hands-on experiments, notes, and product insights at the intersection of AI and Product Management.
# 🧠 ai-product-lab

Welcome to my personal learning lab — a collection of structured notes, side projects, and experiments designed to deepen my skills in AI Product Management.

This repository is a 12-week self-paced journey that combines:
- 🤖 Practical AI concepts (LLMs, prompting, RAG, agents, etc.)
- 📊 Product thinking and metrics
- 🛠️ Hands-on builds and workflows
- 📁 Weekly documentation for transparency and growth

### 🧭 Objectives
- Develop strong intuition around building AI-powered products
- Apply prompting techniques and model understanding in real use cases
- Design and evaluate AI systems with product impact in mind
- Build a public artifact that showcases real, applied learning
